# Greeting App with Node.js and React

This project demonstrates a simple backend and frontend interaction. It consists of two parts:

1. **Backend (Node.js & Express)** - A simple API that returns a personalized greeting message.
2. **Frontend (React)** - A simple user interface where users can input their name and get a greeting message from the backend.

## Features

- **Backend (Node.js & Express)**:
  - An API endpoint: `GET /api/greet?name=YourName`
  - If the `name` query parameter is provided, it returns a JSON response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello, YourName! Welcome to Younglabs."
    }
    ```
  - If the `name` query parameter is missing, it returns:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Name is required."
    }
    ```

- **Frontend (React)**:
  - An input field where users can enter their name.
  - A button that fetches the greeting message from the backend when clicked.
  - Displays the message or error on the page.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:


### Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greeting-app.git
cd greeting-app
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)

1. Navigate to the `greeting-api` folder (or the root folder where your `server.js` file is located):

   ```bash
   cd greeting-api
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3001`. If you want to change the port, modify the `server.js` file.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the `greet-frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd greet-frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Documentation

- **Endpoint**: `/api/greet`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameter**: `name` (Required)

#### Responses:

- **Success**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello, YourName! Welcome to Younglabs."
    }
    ```

- **Error (if `name` is missing)**:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Name is required."
    }
    ```

### Example

1. Enter a name (e.g., "John") in the input field on the React page and click "Get Greeting."

    ```
    "Name is required."
    ```

### Notes:

- **Backend Setup**: The backend code should be placed in the `backend/` folder, and the frontend in the `frontend/` folder.
- **Deployment**: The `Bonus (Optional but Preferred)` section helps you deploy your project to platforms like Vercel (for the frontend) and Render (for the backend).
- **Folder Structure**: The folder structure section explains how to organize the project into backend and frontend parts.

This should serve as a good starting point for anyone looking to understand your project. Let me know if you need any more modifications!
