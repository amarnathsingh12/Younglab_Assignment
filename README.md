Hereâ€™s a **README.md** file that I can use for my project:

# Greeting App with Node.js and React

This project demonstrates a simple backend and frontend interaction. It consists of two parts:

1. **Backend (Node.js & Express)** - A simple API that returns a personalized greeting message.
2. **Frontend (React)** - A simple user interface where users can input their name and get a greeting message from the backend.

#### 2. Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)

1. Navigate to the `greeting-api` folder (or the root folder where your `server.js` file is located):

   ```bash
   cd greeting-api
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3001`. If you want to change the port, modify the `server.js` file.

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the `greet-frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd greet-frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Documentation

- **Endpoint**: `/api/greet`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameter**: `name` (Required)

#### Responses:

- **Success**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello, YourName! Welcome to Younglabs."
    }
    ```

- **Error (if `name` is missing)**:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Name is required."
    }
    ```

### Example

1. Enter a name (e.g., "John") in the input field on the React page and click "Get Greeting."
2. The response from the backend API should be displayed as:
    ```
    "Hello, John! Welcome to Younglabs."
    ```

3. If you don't enter a name and click the button, you should see the error:
    ```
    "Name is required."
    ```
